                    On May 25, 2020, a convenience store employee called the police on George Floyd who had bought
                    cigarettes with an alleged counterfeit bill. Shorty after the call, two police officers arrived on
                    the scene. Ex-officer, Thomas Lane, pulled his gun on Mr. Floyd immediately and continued to
                    handcuff him. Once both officers tried to transfer Mr. Floyd to the squad car, he stiffened up and
                    fell to the ground due to being claustrophobic. Ex-officer, Derek Chauvin, arrived at the scene and
                    attempted to assist the other officers in detaining Mr. Floyd, but instead pulled him away from the
                    car, causing him to fall on the ground. Chauvin then placed his knee between Mr. Floyd's head and
                    neck. Ex officers, J. Alexander Keung and Tom Thao stood by and watched. Mr. Floyd repeatedly
                    shouted
                    <b>"I can't breathe"</b>
                    and pleaded for his mother, as Chauvin held his knee there for
                    <b>8 minutes and 46 seconds</b>
                    . Mr. Floyd took his last breath around the sixth minute. After Chauvin removed his knee, Mr. Floyd
                    laid there motionless, with no pulse, and was pronounced dead about an hour later. Chauvin has been
                    charged with second-degree murder along with other counts, while Lane, Keung, and Thao face charges
                    of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.

                    On February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery went for a jog in Satilla Shores when he ran past the front yard
                    of Gregory McMichael. Gregory believed that Mr. Arbery looked similar to a man responsible for
                    several break-ins in the area, so he called his son, Travis McMichael. Both Gregory and Travis
                    grabbed a .357 Magnum handgun and shotgun, and chased Mr. Arbery in a pickup truck. The McMichael's
                    attempted to cut Mr. Arbery off, but were unsuccessful as he began to
                    <b>run for his life</b>
                    . As he ran, he passed the truck of William Bryan Jr., the McMichael's neighbor, who recorded and
                    eventually joined the chase. Mr. Arbery ran until he was trapped between the two trucks, and Travis
                    McMichael got out of his truck with the shotgun. Mr. Arbery fought for his life when he was
                    <b>shot 3 times</b>
                    by Travis, followed by the yelling of a racial slur. Mr. Arbery stumbled and fell in the middle of
                    the street, taking his last breath. All 3 men have since been arrested 2 months later and indicted
                    on 9 counts, including felony murder.

                    A short time after midnight n March 13, 2020, three Louisville police officers Brett Hankison, Jon
                    Mattingly, and Myles Cosgrove were sent to Breonna Taylor's home to execute a "no-knock" warrant.
                    Upon arrival, the officers began to use a battering ram to enter Ms. Taylor's apartment, while she
                    and her boyfriend were in bed. The loud banging led to Kenneth Walker, Ms. Taylor's boyfriend,
                    grabbed his own weapon and fired the gun at the officers. The officers retaliated and shot Ms.
                    Taylor
                    <b>at least 8 times</b>
                    . The officers were believed to have been investigating 2 men that were selling drugs far from Ms.
                    Taylor's home and no drugs were found in her apartment. Hankison was fired from the Louisville Metro
                    Police Department while Mattingly and Cosgrove have been placed on administrative reassignment.

                    On June 12, 2020, a complaint was made at a Wendy's restuarant about a man asleep in his car that
                    was obstructing other vehicles in the drive-through lane. Police officers, Devin Brosnan and Garrett
                    Rolfe, responded to the complaint and later identified the man to be Rayshard Brooks. Brosnan and
                    Rolfe had Mr. Brooks pull over to a nearby parking space, and engaged in a calm and friendly
                    conversation. The officers administered a sobriety and breath test, to which Mr. Brooks was
                    compliant, and soon determined that he had too much to drink to be driving. As they tried to
                    handcuff Mr. Brooks, he broke free but was soon tackled by the officers. While on the ground, Rolfe
                    <b>kicked Mr. Brook's body</b>
                    as Bronsan held him down. Mr. Brooks soon got a hold of Brosnan's taser, and punched Rolfe as he
                    broke free again. As Mr. Brooks was running, he half turns around and fires the taser at Rolfe, who
                    then unholsters his handgun and fires at Mr. Brooks
                    <b>3 times</b>
                    . Mr. Brooks was rushed to the hospital 14 minutes after the shooting, but died following surgery.
                    Rolfe has since been fired and faces 11 criminal charges, including felony murder and aggravated
                    assault with a deadly weapon. Bronsan was placed on administrative leave and faces 3 charges,
                    including violation of oath and aggravated assault.

                    Shortly after 3:30 a.m. on June 10, 2020, a passerby noticed Robert Fuller's body hanging from a
                    tree at a courtyard outside of Palmdale City Hall. According to the Los Angeles County medical
                    examiner's office, Mr. Fuller's death was ruled as suicide. Although homocide investigators reported
                    that Mr. Fuller's body showed no signs of a struggle, his family doesn't believe he killed himself.
                    An old high school friend, Tommie Anderson, believed that Mr. Fuller wouldn't have been out that
                    late, and the tree branches were too thin to have supported his weight for long. Anderson also
                    believed that Mr. Fuller was too tall for his body to hang from the lower branches, so for him to
                    tie himself to the tree was not possible. Officials claimed that there are no security cameras or
                    footage to look at, although the tree was in an area surrounded by a fire station, church, and many
                    small businesses. An increased amount of skepticism continues to arise, as protesters and activists
                    suspect Mr. Fuller was
                    <b>lynched</b>
                    . On June 15, 2020, Palmdale officials exclaimed that they planned to support and expand their
                    independent investigation on Mr. Fuller's death. Since then, the FBI has began to look into his
                    case.

                    On May 30, 2020, James Scurlock was protesting about the death of George Floyd and police brutality.
                    Protesters, including himself, went to the Hive Bar and Gatsby Bar in Omaha's Old Market
                    neighborhood. Around midnight, the father of Jacob Gardner, who is the owner of the bar, began to
                    push several protesters while asking them to leave the bar. Gardner was tackled by protesters in the
                    street outside of his bar, and proceeded to pull out a gun and fire 2 shots in the air. Mr. Scurlock
                    jumped on his back, when Gardner
                    <b>fatally shot him in the clavicle</b>
                    . Mr. Scurlock was rushed to the hospital where he later died from his injuries. Gardner was taken
                    into police custody, but he was released shortly after, proclaiming Mr. Scurlock's murder was
                    justified. Gardner had an expired concealed carry permit, but
                    <b>no charges have been made against him</b>
                    .

                    On August 24, 2019, Elijah McClain was walking home after buying an iced tea from a convenience
                    store when someone called 911, reporting a sketchy man in a ski mask. Mr. McClain had anemia and
                    routinely wore ski masks since he would get cold easily. Officers, Nathan Woodyard, Jason
                    Rosenblatt, and Randy Roedema, arrived to the scene and attempted to stop Mr. McClain, who asked
                    them to respect his boundaries. The situation escalated and the officers took Mr. McClain down to
                    the ground. Woodyard then applied a
                    <b>carotid control hold around Mr. McClain's neck</b>
                    , causing him to vomit several times. After paramedics arrived on the scene, they injected Mr.
                    McClain with
                    <b>ketamine</b>
                    to sedate him as the officers continued to hold him down. On the way to the hospital, he went into
                    <b>cardiac arrest</b>
                    and was pronounced brain dead on August 27, 2020. Mr. McClain was taken off of life support on 3
                    days later. Body cam footage was not released until 3 months later. All 3 officers were placed on
                    administrative leave, but have since returned to work. They have yet to be charged.

                    On May 31, 2020, Justin Howell was out protesting George Floyd's death when a protester standing
                    next to him hurled a water bottle and bag at the police officers. The police officer responded by
                    <b>firing beanbag rounds but struck Mr. Howell in the head instead</b>
                    . Mr. Howell then fell to the ground, and the surrounding crowd picked him up, being directed to
                    take him to police headquarters by officers. As they tried to bring Mr. Howell towards medical help,
                    the officers fired into the crowd helping him, using less-lethal munitions. After he was given
                    medical attention, it was determined that Mr. Howell had suffered a
                    <b>fractured skull and brain damage</b>
                    . Mr. Howell currently remains in critical condition and no officers have been charged.

                    Jamel Floyd had been an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since October 2019.
                    On June 3, 2020, Mr. Floyd was barricaded inside of his cell and bacame disruptive and harmful to
                    himself by breaking the cell door window with a metal object, according to the Justice department.
                    Officers then
                    <b>deployed pepper spray</b>
                    and removed him from his cell, causing Mr. Floyd to become unresponsive. After being transported to
                    the hospital, he was pronounced dead by the staff. Mr. Floyd
                    <b>suffered from asthma</b>
                    , and the excessive use of pepper spray can lead to fatal consequences. New York City Chief Medical
                    Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson claims her office is in the process of investigating Mr. Floyd's death,
                    as there is a belief that the officers had to have done something in addition to pepper spraying Mr.
                    Floyd to cause his death. No officers have been charged.
