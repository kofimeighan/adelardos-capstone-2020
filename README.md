# Google Student Training in Engineering Program Capstone Project

This repo contains the capstone project for Bria Fassler, Kofi Meighan, and Jacob Chidawaya. Our goal for this project is to create an informational website relating to the Black Lives Matter movement that brings the user information and action that can be taken from anywhere. This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.
